# ADR 0005: The record format, versioned as horus-lineage/v1

Status: accepted, confirmed upstream

## Context

Records are read by external tools, possibly years after they were
written and by software that did not exist when they were written. The
fields must be stable, self-identifying, and allowed to evolve without
silently changing the meaning of old records.

## Decision

Plain JSON, one object per file. Every file carries a format field.
A semantic change to any field is a new version, never an edit.
Readers check the format field and refuse versions they do not know,
rather than guessing.

A missing `finished_at` means the run died partway. The task records
that exist are the lineage of how far it got.

`definition.json` is a projection, not a dump. A full model dump would
carry whatever fields third-party targets and executors define, which
may include credentials, and records must be safe to share. The
projection is an explicit allowlist: task ids, names and kinds, executor
and runtime kinds, referenced code paths, target kinds and location ids,
declared artifact ids and paths, and edges. Fields the recorder does not
know about are dropped rather than passed through.

`labels` is what a reader groups by without knowing the domain. A
workflow author writes `labels: {subject: batch_017}` on an artifact and
a reader can then answer "everything derived from subject batch_017"
with a lookup, rather than parsing filenames or consulting a sheet that
describes a different vocabulary per field of study.

Recorded verbatim and never interpreted. Only string keys and values are
kept, because a reader indexes on them and a value it cannot compare is
worse than an absent one. Absent entirely when an artifact has none, so
an unlabelled run reads exactly as it did before the field existed.

The `environment` digests are hashes only, never the model dumps, for the
same reason `definition.json` is a projection: a third-party executor may
hold credentials. `config_sha256` is copied verbatim from what the engine
computes, so a reader inherits the engine's invalidation rule instead of
reimplementing one that can drift. The two component digests exist
because the engine's combined hash says *that* something changed and not
*which*, and naming the cause is the point.

`code` is per task, not only per run. run.json keeps a rollup for
convenience, but a run-level list can only say that some script changed.
Attributing digests to the task that ran them is what turns a changed
file into a set of affected tasks and, through `target`, the machines
those tasks run on.

Two fields are verbatim and only as clean as the workflow. `command` is
the substituted command line, so a secret passed as an argument lands in
the record, and `source` is the workflow file byte for byte. The engine
projection keeps a plugin's credentials out. It cannot keep out what the
author typed. Recording the command can be switched off per run.

### What a change is and is not detectable in

The format answers "what is affected when X changed" for some kinds of X
and honestly cannot for others. A reader should be built knowing which.

**A script changed.** Detectable, and since horus-runtime 0.5.0 the
engine detects it too. A runtime holds its script as a path, so the
runtime dump and `config_sha256` do not move when the file is edited.
Before 0.5.0 the script was outside the fingerprint as well, and a
local run showed the consequence: the engine skipped the task, kept the
stale output, and applied the edit two runs later when an unrelated
input change happened to invalidate the cache. Each runtime and
executor now declares its local files through `local_files()`, the
engine digests them into the fingerprint, and the task re-runs.

The per-task `code` digests keep their job under 0.5.0. The engine's
fingerprint says *that* the task is stale, and `code` says *which* file
moved, attributed to the tasks that read it.

A templated script, `script: ${my_script}`, names an input artifact
rather than a local file and is an ordinary input.

**A declared environment changed.** Detectable. An image reference,
a requirements list or an interpreter lives in the executor's model, so
it is inside `config_sha256` and inside the executor digest. The engine
invalidates and the record names the cause.

**A mutable environment reference changed.** Not detectable. An image tag
re-pushed under the same name is byte-identical in the executor's model.
The engine is blind and so is the recorder. Pinning by digest is the only
fix and it belongs to the workflow author.

**A tool on the target host changed.** Not detectable. A package upgrade,
a swapped conda environment or a new driver is outside everything Horus
models. Measuring it is a profiler's job, not a recorder's.

### Skipped tasks

A skipped task is the common case in any workflow that is re-run, and
the two skip reasons are not the same thing.

`complete` means the engine verified that the declared outputs exist and
that a recorded fingerprint matches the current inputs and configuration.
It is a positive confirmation, not an absence of work, and the outputs it
confirms are real files with real digests. The record is therefore
written in full:

    outputs      digested normally, they exist, that is why the task
                 skipped
    inputs       digests read from the engine's fingerprint manifest,
                 which is what the skip decision was made against and is
                 therefore equal to the current input state by
                 construction
    environment  recorded normally, it comes from the task's model
    code         recorded normally, the files are on the orchestrator
                 whether or not the task ran
    command      null, nothing was resolved

`environment` and `code` matter more on a skipped record than on an
executed one. A workflow re-run daily is mostly skips, so omitting them
would mean a changed script maps to none of the tasks that use it,
precisely because those tasks were cached.

A `complete` record joins into a downstream graph identically to an
executed one. Without the fingerprint read it would carry no digests, no
edges would form, and its consumers' inputs would be misread as files
supplied from outside the pipeline. The chain would break exactly where
caching worked best.

`inactive` means no incoming edge was live, so the task is on a branch
that was not taken. It never ran and has no outputs. The record carries
the status and nothing to join, which is accurate rather than a gap.

Nothing marks a run stale. A run made largely of skips is the freshest
confirmation available, and it may be the only run directory a reader
holds. Deciding which runs to weigh is the reader's judgment, not the
recorder's, consistent with ADR 0004.

### Recording what was missed

`incomplete` is a list of short codes naming what this record could not
capture. It is empty in the ordinary case.

    digests_disabled   digests were switched off for this run
    digests_partial    digests were on, and some artifact still has none

A missing fingerprint manifest is not listed. Falling back to hashing the
bytes costs a read and loses nothing, and some task kinds never write one.
What a reader needs is whether an artifact ended up without a digest,
because that is an edge it will not see: a folder, a file that no longer
exists, or a subworkflow port, which is a boundary placeholder rather than
a file on disk.

This is mechanical, not evaluative. The recorder states what it failed to
observe and leaves the reader to decide what that is worth, which is the
same principle as ADR 0004's treatment of missing records: degrade to
unknown, never to clean.

## Consequences

Old records stay readable forever under their own version. Field
additions that change no meaning may land within v1, anything else is v2.

The projection in `definition.json` means the recorder must be updated
when a field worth recording appears upstream. That is the cost of never
leaking a credential by default, and it is the right way round: a
recorder that omits a new field is incomplete, one that passes through
an unknown field may be unpublishable.

A record answers "what is affected when this changed" for three kinds of
change: an input, a script, and a declared environment. Each resolves to
a set of tasks and, through `target`, to the machines those tasks run on.
What that recomputation costs is not recorded and not inferred. The
machines are the signal, and whoever owns them prices it.

Per-task `code` digests were, before horus-runtime 0.5.0, the only thing
that detected an edited script. The gap was reported upstream and
closed. A reader of records from an older engine should still not trust
it to have invalidated on a code change.

The affected set is an upper bound, not an answer. A task re-runs only
when its own inputs or config changed, so a task that produces identical
bytes from changed inputs halts the cascade. A local run shows it: a
whitespace edit to an input re-ran the first task, whose output came out
byte-identical, and both downstream tasks skipped. A reader that walks
the full downstream closure should say which of it is certain.
